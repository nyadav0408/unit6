Static Node.js and Express Site

Project Description:
I completed this project as a member of the Team Treehouse TalentPath program. Team Treehouse provided the html and css layouts, and I completed the logic in JavaScript.  

For this project, I've built a Node.js website with Express and Pug to present a personal portfolio of the first five projects I completed for the TalentPath program. The information about the projects is contained in a JSON file, from which I have created individual show pages for each project.     

Motivation:
The purpose of the project is to create my first Node.js website and practice with the Express web server framework and the pug template engine.

Getting Started/Installation:
Once you've downloaded the repo, navigate to its root directory in the terminal. Then enter the 'npm install' command to install all dependencies. You can enter either 'node app.js' or 'npm start' to start the servers. Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000/.  

Personalizations in CSS (Exceeds Expectations requirement):
To personalize my portfolio site, I have changed the background color of the website to light blue, changed the main font-family to Libre Baskerville (a Google Font), added text shadows to the h5 and h6 tags, and added a box shadow to images and buttons. I have also added two classes (.error and .error-stack) to my error.pug template to format it and make it more readable for a client. Each of these changes is marked with 'My change' in the css/style.css file.
